I created a startpage with a navigationbar which has two dropdown options.

I achieved that while giving the dropdown boxes display none and then gave them a class which has display block.

This class gets toggled on with Javascript when you click on the navigationbar element.



(Because my main focus was to practice dropdown menus, this project has no media querys tho and is hardly responsive)
